# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this is a project in active development, only the most recent version available in the `main` branch is actively supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, I ask you to report it privately.

**Please do not open a public issue.**

Instead, please send an email to:
**[cioffimatteo800@gmail.com]**

I will do my best to acknowledge your report as soon as possible, analyze the issue, and outline the next steps.

# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SaveState!

## Current Status

This is a solo project managed by a single developer. Due to a specific (AI-assisted) development workflow, it is very difficult for me to review, test, and integrate external code contributions safely and effectively.

**Because of this, I am not accepting code contributions (Pull Requests) at this time.**

This policy ensures I can maintain the project's quality and security standards.

## You can still help!

Your feedback and ideas are highly valuable. If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please **open an Issue** using one of our templates. This is the best way to contribute to the project's development.

Thank you for your understanding!
